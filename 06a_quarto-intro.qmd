subtitle: "Next generation scientific publishing in R"

Quarto is a **modern, open-source, and flexible platform for creating documents, reports, presentations, and more, primarily focused on data science and technical writing**. 

Quarto is built on top of R Markdown and Pandoc, and is designed to be easy to use, highly customizable, and to produce high-quality output.

*Quarto is a standalone tool but does ship with later versions of Rstudio. Upgrades do need to be downloaded and installed manually however. See Quarto [Download](https://quarto.org/docs/download/) page for latest release.*
:::

Quarto has an **active community of users and contributors who provide support, share tips and tricks, and contribute to the development of the platform**. This community aspect fosters learning and collaboration among users.

Quarto is **closely related to literate programming in its philosophy and functionality. **

## Literate programming

Literate programming is a programming paradigm first introduced by **Donald E. Knuth**.

> **Treat program as literature meant to be understandable to human beings**
>
> -   move away from writing programs in the manner and order imposed by the computer
> -   **focus instead on the logic and flow of human thought and understanding**
> -   single document to integrate data analysis (executable code) with textual documentation, **linking data, code, and text**

### Why is this important in science:

#### **Enables reproducibility**

Enables reproducibility through packaging code, text and output into a single executable document.

#### **Enables open science**

Literate programming allows us to record and publish information and discussions about code and analyses in more readable formats.

## **Literate programming in R**

### Quarto (`qmd`) Overview

**Quarto integrates:**

– a **documentation** language (`.md`)

– a number of **programming** languages (including `R`)

Allows us to combine **tools, processes** and **outputs** into interactive, reproducible **evidence streams** that are easily shareable, particularly through the web.

#### A researchers perspective on Quarto

A reproducible workflow in action:

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_app("https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3JldKoA0zw")
```

## Elements of Quarto

### **markdown {`.md`}**

Simplified version of the **`html`** markup language. User can focus on communicating & disseminating

-   intended to be as **easy-to-read** and **easy-to-write** as possible.

-   most powerful as a **format for writing to the web.**

-   **syntax is very small**, corresponding only to a very small subset of HTML tags.

-   clean and legible **across platforms (even mobile) and outputs.**

-   **formatting handled automatically**

-   html **markup language also handled**.

### **code {r,** python, SQL, ... **}**

-   **Code chunks defined through special notation. Executed in sequence**. Exceution of individual chunks controllable

-   **Analysis self-contained and reproducible**

    -   Run in a fresh R session every time document is knit.

-   A number of [Language Engines](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_knitr_engines.html) are supported by `knitr`

    -   **R** (default)
    -   Python
    -   SQL
    -   Bash
    -   Julia
    -   Observable

## Quarto **Outputs**

Quarto can output to a variety of formats, including:

-   HTML
-   PDF
-   Word

Which can be combined into a variety of more complex formats, including:

-   Slides
-   Books
-   Dashboards
-   Websites
-   Manuscripts

```{r, out.width="60%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/RMarkdownOutputFormats.png")
```

**Superpower: Simple interface to powerful modern web technologies and libraries**

## Quarto extensions

Quarto has a [number of extensions](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/), many community contributed, that make it even more powerful:

Examples of Quarto extensions include:

\- **fontawesome**: Use Font Awesome icons in HTML and PDF documents.

\- **academicons**: Use Academicons in HTML documents.

\- **line-highlight**: Filter to enable source code and output line highlighting for HTML documents.

And much more!

All this makes it incredibly versatile.

## Publish to the web for free!

### **Quarto Pub**:

[Quarto Pub](https://quartopub.com/) is a free publishing service for content created with Quarto. Quarto Pub is ideal for blogs, course or project websites, books, presentations, and personal hobby sites.

[![](assets/quarto_pub.png)](https://quartopub.com/)

Quarto Pub allows you to publish rendered quarto documents and websites to the web for free with a simple command.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| filename: "Terminal"
quarto publish quarto-pub
```

## Applications of Quarto in research

`qmd` documents can be useful for a number of research related materials

-   [**Vignettes**](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html): long form documentation.
    -   Analyses
    -   Documentation (code & data)
    -   Supplementary materials
-   Reports
-   Papers
-   Personal research websites and blogs
-   Theses!

### Citations & Footnotes

![](assets/citations-quarto.png)

[See more](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html)

Quarto can generate citations and a bibliography in a number of styles. You will need:

-   A bibliographic data source, (.bib) or (.bibtex) file.

-   Optionally, a CSL file which specifies the formatting to use when generating the citations and bibliography.

Scholarly articles require much more detail in their front matter & Quarto provides a rich set of YAML metadata keys to describe these details:

-   authors and their affiliations,
-   abstracts and keywords.
-   information on copyright, licensing and funding.
