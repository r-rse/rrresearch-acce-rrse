## Ice Breaker

### Split into break out rooms

### Introduce yourselves

### Q: Why did you decide to join this course?

# Why are we here?

## The paper is the advertisement

> “an article about computational result is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the **full software environment, code and data, that produced the result.**”

*John Claerbout paraphrased in [Buckheit and Donoho (1995)](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~wavelab/Wavelab_850/wavelab.pdf)*

## Lessons from the Reproducibility/Replicability crisis

-   Many issues statistical and a results of broken Academic incentive systems.

-   Much can be tackled by transparency and better computational literacy.

ROGER D. PENG, SCIENCE 02 DEC 2011 : 1226-1227

> Reproducibility has the potential to serve as a minimum standard for judging scientific claims when full independent replication of a study is not possible.

## **Research meta-responsibilities**

We need better digital curation of the workhorses of modern science: **code** & **data**

> **aim to create secure materials that are [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)** *findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable*

![](assets/FAIRPrinciples.jpg){fig-align="center" width="700"}

## **Research meta-responsibilities**

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Think about traceability and provenance.

-   Follow community conventions.

-   Prepare it to share it.

## **Drivers of better digital management**

-   **Funders**: value for money, impact, reputation

-   **Publishers**: many now require code and data.

    -   Specialist journals have emerged for:
        -   **software**: [Journal of Open Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org/), [MEE](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/2041210x)
        -   **data**: [Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/))

-   **PIs, Supervisors and immediate research group**

-   Your **wider scientific community**

-   The **public**

## **Yourselves!**

**Be your own best friend:**

## **Ultimately it's about getting a handle on our research materials**

## The concept of a Research Compendium

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
> “ ...We introduce the **concept of a compendium** as both a **container** for the different **elements that make up the document and its computations** (i.e. text, code, data, ...), and as a **means for distributing, managing and updating the collection**."

## Back to "Why are we here?"

-   To show you howto use R + Rstudio to perform reproducible data analyses.

. . .

-   To help you make the most of the real workhorses of your work, **YOUR CODE & DATA**!

. . .

-   To help you be empowered by modern tools & technologies rather than be overwhelmed by them.

. . .

-   To help you lead the culture change rather than be burdened by increased requirements.

. . .

-   Ultimately, to **change how science works for better for everyone**!

-   We'll do this by introducing you to **useful data and software tools and best practices**.

**We'll take regular breaks and aim to break for lunch between 13:00 - 14:00 for an hour**

# Before we dive in

-   We'll exploring best practice in data and workflow management. I've tried to focus on concepts and tools that I wish I knew when I started.

. . .

-   We'll explore individual tools and concepts and show how they work nicely together.

. . .

-   We'll be coding together and working in Posit Cloud.

. . .

-   Feedback: After each day, let me know on the notepad:
    -   :green_book: : somethind you liked
    -   :red_circle: : somethind that could be improved

. . .

-   Please feel free to ask questions if I use jargon you don't understand or need some clarification. Questions are helpful for everyone! :sparkles:

## Working on Zoom

-   Have your mic on mute by default.

. . .

-   Please try to have your camera on as much as possible.

. . .

-   You can use the chat for questions but better to interrupt me.

. . .

-   Please try to help each other!

. . .

-  If you get lost, the materials and appendices are your friend!

. . . 

-   Use status reaction emojis to communicate how it's going.

. . .


## A note about Posit Cloud Projects

-   Please also **do not share the link to Course Shared space on Posit Cloud**.
-   Posit Cloud projects **will be deleted after a week** of the course ending. Please [**download any work you want to keep.**]
