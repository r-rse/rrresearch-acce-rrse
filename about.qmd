This course is funded by NERC through the [ACCE Doctoral Partnership](https://accedtp.ac.uk/) program

It started in 2015 by [Dr. Tom Webb](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/aps/staff-and-students/acadstaff/webb) & [Dr. Anna Krystalli](https://www.r-rse.eu/) of R-RSE and has been continued since 2016 by Dr Anna Krystalli.

Since then it has gone from a one day course on Data management to a four day course, encompassing project management, version control and scientific reporting, packaging code and creating reasearch compendia in R!

It is aimed at preparing first year PhD students for managing their research code and data successfully, in line with shifting expectations on reproducibility, interoperability, accessibility and archiving of research materials.
