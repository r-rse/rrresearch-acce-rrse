Upgrades do need to be downloaded and installed manually however. See Quarto [Download](https://quarto.org/docs/download/) page for latest release.*\n:::\n\nQuarto has an **active community of users and contributors who provide support, share tips and tricks, and contribute to the development of the platform**. This community aspect fosters learning and collaboration among users.\n\nQuarto is **closely related to literate programming in its philosophy and functionality. **\n\n## Literate programming\n\nLiterate programming is a programming paradigm first introduced by **Donald E. Knuth**.\n\n> **Treat program as literature meant to be understandable to human beings**\n>\n> -   move away from writing programs in the manner and order imposed by the computer\n> -   **focus instead on the logic and flow of human thought and understanding**\n> -   single document to integrate data analysis (executable code) with textual documentation, **linking data, code, and text**\n\n### Why is this important in science:\n\n#### **Enables reproducibility**\n\nEnables reproducibility through packaging code, text and output into a single executable document.\n\n#### **Enables open science**\n\nLiterate programming allows us to record and publish information and discussions about code and analyses in more readable formats.\n\n## **Literate programming in R**\n\n### Quarto (`qmd`) Overview\n\n**Quarto integrates:**\n\n– a **documentation** language (`.md`)\n\n– a number of **programming** languages (including `R`)\n\nAllows us to combine **tools, processes** and **outputs** into interactive, reproducible **evidence streams** that are easily shareable, particularly through the web.\n\n#### A researchers perspective on Quarto\n\nA reproducible workflow in action:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3JldKoA0zw?showcase=0\" width=\"672\" height=\"400px\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe>\n:::\n\n\n## Elements of Quarto\n\n### **markdown {`.md`}**\n\nSimplified version of the **`html`** markup language. User can focus on communicating & disseminating\n\n-   intended to be as **easy-to-read** and **easy-to-write** as possible.\n\n-   most powerful as a **format for writing to the web.**\n\n-   **syntax is very small**, corresponding only to a very small subset of HTML tags.\n\n-   clean and legible **across platforms (even mobile) and outputs.**\n\n-   **formatting handled automatically**\n\n-   html **markup language also handled**.\n\n### **code {r,** python, SQL, ... **}**\n\n-   **Code chunks defined through special notation. Executed in sequence**. Exceution of individual chunks controllable\n\n-   **Analysis self-contained and reproducible**\n\n    -   Run in a fresh R session every time document is knit.\n\n-   A number of [Language Engines](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_knitr_engines.html) are supported by `knitr`\n\n    -   **R** (default)\n    -   Python\n    -   SQL\n    -   Bash\n    -   Julia\n    -   Observable\n\n## Quarto **Outputs**\n\nQuarto can output to a variety of formats, including:\n\n-   HTML\n-   PDF\n-   Word\n\nWhich can be combined into a variety of more complex formats, including:\n\n-   Slides\n-   Books\n-   Dashboards\n-   Websites\n-   Manuscripts\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](assets/RMarkdownOutputFormats.png){width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Superpower: Simple interface to powerful modern web technologies and libraries**\n\n## Quarto extensions\n\nQuarto has a [number of extensions](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/), many community contributed, that make it even more powerful:\n\nExamples of Quarto extensions include:\n\n\\- **fontawesome**: Use Font Awesome icons in HTML and PDF documents.\n\n\\- **academicons**: Use Academicons in HTML documents.\n\n\\- **line-highlight**: Filter to enable source code and output line highlighting for HTML documents.\n\nAnd much more!\n\nAll this makes it incredibly versatile.\n\n## Publish to the web for free!\n\n### **Quarto Pub**:\n\n[Quarto Pub](https://quartopub.com/) is a free publishing service for content created with Quarto. Quarto Pub is ideal for blogs, course or project websites, books, presentations, and personal hobby sites.\n\n[![](assets/quarto_pub.png)](https://quartopub.com/)\n\nQuarto Pub allows you to publish rendered quarto documents and websites to the web for free with a simple command.\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='Terminal'}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nquarto publish quarto-pub\n```\n:::\n\n\nLearn more: <https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/quarto-pub.html>\n\n## Applications of Quarto in research\n\n`qmd` documents can be useful for a number of research related materials\n\n-   [**Vignettes**](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html): long form documentation.\n    -   Analyses\n    -   Documentation (code & data)\n    -   Supplementary materials\n-   Reports\n-   Papers\n-   Personal research websites and blogs\n-   Theses!\n\n## Quarto Features for Scientific Publishing\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### Citations & Footnotes\n\n![](assets/citations-quarto.png)\n\n[See more](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html)\n\nQuarto can generate citations and a bibliography in a number of styles. You will need:\n\n-   A bibliographic data source, (.bib) or (.bibtex) file.\n\n-   Optionally, a CSL file which specifies the formatting to use when generating the citations and bibliography.\n\n### Front matter\n\n::: grid\n::: g-col-8\n``` yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Toward a Unified Theory of High-Energy Metaphysics: Silly String Theory\"\ndate: 2008-02-29\nauthor:\n  - name: Josiah Carberry\n    id: jc\n    orcid: 0000-0002-1825-0097\n    email: josiah@psychoceramics.org\n    affiliation: \n      - name: Brown University\n        city: Providence\n        state: RI\n        url: www.brown.edu\nabstract: > \n  The characteristic theme of the works of Stone is \n  the bridge between culture and society. ...\nkeywords:\n  - Metaphysics\n  - String Theory\nlicense: \"CC BY\"\ncopyright: \n  holder: Josiah Carberry\n  year: 2008\ncitation: \n  container-title: Journal of Psychoceramics\n  volume: 1\n  issue: 1\n  doi: 10.5555/12345678\nfunding: \"The author received no specific funding for this work.\"\n---\n```\n\n[See more](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/front-matter.html)\n:::\n\n::: g-col-4\n![](assets/frontmatter-quarto.png)\n:::\n:::\n\nScholarly articles require much more detail in their front matter & Quarto provides a rich set of YAML metadata keys to describe these details:\n\n-   authors and their affiliations,\n-   abstracts and keywords.\n-   information on copyright, licensing and funding.\n\n### Cross-references\n\n::: grid\n::: g-col-6\nAdding a reference to an image:\n\n``` md\n![Elephant](elephant.png){#fig-elephant}\n```\n\nReferencing the image:\n\n``` md\nSee @fig-elephant for an illustration.\n```\n\n[See more](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html)\n:::\n\n::: g-col-6\n![](assets/crossref-quarto.png)\n:::\n:::\n\nCross-references make it easier for readers to navigate your document by providing numbered references and hyperlinks to various entities like figures and tables\n\n### more...\n\n-   [Equations](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#equations)\n-   [Diagrams](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#diagrams)\n-   [Tables](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html)\n-   [Figures](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html)\n:::\n\n## Resources\n\n### Quarto cheatsheet\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n<iframe src=\"assets/cheatsheets/quarto.pdf\" width=\"672\" height=\"400px\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe>\n:::\n\n\n### Quarto Guide\n\nComprehensive guide to using Quarto.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n<iframe src=\"https://quarto.org/docs/guide/\" width=\"672\" height=\"400px\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe>\n:::\n\n\n### Quarto Reference\n\nOptions reference for formats, code cells, and projects.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n<iframe src=\"https://quarto.org/docs/reference/\" width=\"672\" height=\"400px\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe>\n:::\n\n\n### Quarto Tutorials\n\nTutorial to get started with Quarto.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n<iframe src=\"https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\" width=\"672\" height=\"400px\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe>\n:::\n\n\n### Quarto Gallery\n\nCheck out the [Quarto gallery](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html) for ideas.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n<iframe src=\"https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/\" width=\"672\" height=\"400px\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe>\n:::\n\n\n### Quarto Extensions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n<iframe src=\"https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/\" width=\"672\" height=\"400px\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe>\n:::\n",
