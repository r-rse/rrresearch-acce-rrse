This will save a lot of time by avoiding having to debug individual installation problems.\n\nTo start working in R and Rstudio in the Cloud, we need to **log in to Posit Cloud**:\n\n##### [Launch Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/){.btn .btn-primary target=\"_blank\"}\n\nThis will normally end up with logging you into your account workspace. To start working in R, we need to create a new project. Click on **New Project**\n\n![](assets/rsc_new_proj.png)\n\nThis creates and deploys a new untitled Posit Cloud project in your Workspace.\n\n![](assets/rsc_new_proj_deploy.png)\n\nEdit the project names by clicking on **Untitled**. Name it something like **r_basics**\n\n![](assets/rsc_new_proj_name.png)\n\nWe are now in Rstudio, running in the cloud and can start running R code!\n\n### Quick Tour of RStudio in the Cloud\n\n![](assets/rsc_rstudio.png)\n\n-   **Console**: Where you can type and execute R commands. At the top of the console, you can also see the working directory.\n-   **Environment**: Where you can see the objects you have created and their properties.\n-   **Files**: Where you can see the files in your project.\n-   **Plots**: Where you can see the plots you have created.\n-   **Packages**: Where you can see the packages you have installed.\n-   **Help**: Where you can see the help files for R functions.\n-   **Viewer**: Where you can see the output of R Markdown documents.\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## Expand To Learn About New Project Creation in RStudio\n\n### Initialise New Project Creation in RStudio\n\nTo create a new project, click on **File \\> New Project \\> New Directory \\> New Project**.\n\n### Specify Project Name and Location\n\nIn the New Project Wizard, specify the name and location of the new project.\n\n![](assets/img/new-project-tab.png) Click on **Create Project** to create the new project.\n\n### New Project Launch\n\nThis should open a new RStudio window with the new project loaded.\n\n![](assets/img/new-project-launch.png)\n\n### Quick Tour of RStudio\n\n![](assets/img/new-project-tour.png)\n\n-   **Console**: Where you can type and execute R commands. At the top of the console, you can also see the working directory.\n-   **Environment**: Where you can see the objects you have created and their properties.\n-   **Files**: Where you can see the files in your project.\n-   **Plots**: Where you can see the plots you have created.\n-   **Packages**: Where you can see the packages you have installed.\n-   **Help**: Where you can see the help files for R functions.\n-   **Viewer**: Where you can see the output of R Markdown documents.\n:::\n\n## Rstudio Cheatsheet\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n<iframe src=\"assets/cheatsheets/rstudio-ide.pdf\" width=\"672\" height=\"400px\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe>\n:::\n\n\n[**Find out more**](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/){target=\"_blank\"}\n",
