Usually accessed via the command line, or a client program.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://git-scm.com/images/logos/downloads/Git-Logo-2Color.png){width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Where did it come from?\n\nGit development began in 2006 after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access to [BitKeeper](http://www.bitkeeper.org/) (at the time the best but proprietary)\n\n## Why use it in research?\n\n::: grid\n::: g-col-md-6\n#### Exhibit A\n\n[![Image: xkcd CC BY-NC 2.5](assets/vc-xkcd.jpg)](https://xkcd.com/)\n:::\n\n::: g-col-md-6\n#### Exhibit B\n\n![Image: \"Piled Higher and Deeper\" by Jorge Cham [www.phdcomics.com](www.phdcomics.com)](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif){height=\"400\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n# What is GitHub :thinking:\n\n![](assets/github_logo.jpg){width=\"50%\"}\n\nA **website** that allows you to **store your Git repositories online** and makes it easy to collaborate with others. They also provide other services like issue (bug) tracking and wikis. Similar services are [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/).\n\n## Why use it in research:\n\nTo enable collaboration and track contributions\n\n<img src=\"assets/workflows.png\" width=\"50%\"/><img src=\"assets/collab.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n\n*images: Mozilla Science Lab* CC-BY 4.0\n\n<br>\n\n-   Acts as a remote back-up\n-   Facilitates transparency\n-   Facilitates project management\n-   Facilitates sharing and collaboration\n-   Super-charges innovation by Open Sourcing Science\n    -   [Mozilla & Working Open](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quKdaqlR_9w)\n    -   [Open Source Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tyd0FO0tko8)\n    -   [Reinventing Discovery](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Reinventing-Discovery-New-Networked-Science/dp/0691160198/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1544031907&sr=8-1&keywords=reinventing+discovery)\n    -   [Macroecological and macroevolutionary patterns emerge in the universe of GNU/Linux operating systems](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.03424)\n\n# Anatomy of GitHub Repo\n\n-   **Readme files**. Create a `README.md` file to explain what your project is, and how to install and use it. `README.md` is the file that is automatically displayed when you open a GitHub repo.\n\n-   **License**. Without some sort of licence, the contents of the repository are technically closed. Some allow users of the code to do anything they like with their code - these are known as permissive licences. Examples are the [MIT Licence](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) or [Apache](https://tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2.0-(apache-2.0)).\n\n    -   <https://choosealicense.com/> - does what it says on the tin and helps you choose a licence. Here are some resources to help you choose:\n    -   <https://tldrlegal.com/> - plain english explanations of licences in bullet form.\n\n-   **Contributing guide** - make a file called `CONTRIBUTING.md` and guidelines for contributors so they know what they should do if they want to help you out.\n\n-   **Code of Conduct** - good projects have codes of conduct to make sure that people are treated well. Github has an [Code of Conduct wizard](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project/) to make it easy to add one.\n\n-   **Issues** - use GitHub issues to record and discuss tasks.\n\n<br>\n\n# Git, Github & Rstudio\n\n### Before: git only through the terminal\n\n![](assets/git_status.png)\n\n### Rstudio & `usethis` to the rescue!\n\n-   Initialise **Rstudio project** with Git by **just checking a box!**\n\n    -   Forgot to? use `usethis::use_git()`\n\n-   visual panel to easily see the status of all your files\n\n-   interactive navigation through file version history\n\n# Version Control Demo\n\n## How does `Git` work?\n\nWhen a local directory becomes ***initialised with git***, a **hidden `.git` folder is added** to it.\n\n> it's now called a **repository**\n\n-   New copies of files you tell git to track will be **added** to that `.git` folder.\n\n-   After adding, git will track any modifications to those files\n\n### first commit - whole file added\n\nAny file unknown to git will have a **yellow ?** box next to it.\n\n![](assets/git-unadded.png)\n\nThe first time you commit a file you are **adding** it to `.git`, effectively telling it to start tracking the file\n\n![](assets/commit1.png)\n\n### second commit - only difference highlighted\n\nThe first time you commit a file, only the changes are shown and any file that has uncommited modifications is shown with a **blue M**\n\n![](assets/commit2.png) When all changes have been committed, the git panel is clear.\n\n![](assets/commit2-file.png)\n\nEnough theory, how about in practice!\n\n# Configure git & GitHub\n\n## Configure git\n\nFirst, `git` needs to know who you are so your commits can be attributed to you. **`usethis`** to the rescue again!\n\n**Check your configuration**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::git_sitrep()\n```\n:::\n\n\n```         \n── Git global (user) \n• Name: <unset>\n• Email: <unset>\n✖ Git user's name and email are not set.

Password-based authentication for Git is deprecated, i.e. you really should *not* be sending your username and password every time you push or pull. Here, I'm referring to the username and password you would use to login to GitHub in the browser.\n\nWhat should you do instead?\n\nGet a **personal access token** (PAT) and use that as your credential for HTTPS operations. (The PAT will actually be sent as the password and the username is somewhat artificial, consulted only for credential lookup.)\n\n#### How to get a PAT?\n\nGitHub offers instructions for [creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).\n\nThe usethis package has a helper function that takes you to the web form to create a PAT, with the added benefit that it pre-selects the recommended scopes:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::create_github_token()\n```\n:::\n\n\n```         \n● Call `credentials::set_github_pat()` to register this token in the local Git credential store\n  It is also a great idea to store this token in any password-management software that you use\n✔ Opening URL 'https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,user,gist,workflow&description=DESCRIBE THE TOKEN\\'S USE CASE'\n```\n\nWill open up the GitHub panel to generate your PAT.\n\nGive your PAT a descriptive name. I'm calling mine `POSIT_CLOUD` as that's the only place I'm going to use it and, for security reasons, I'm setting an expiration date of 7 days, just long enough to complete the course.\n\n![](assets/github_pat_create.png)\n\nOnce you are happy with the selected scopes, scroll to the bottom and click \"Generate token\".\n\nYou will be taken to a page that shows your token. **Make sure you copy it to your clipboard!**.\n\n![](assets/github_pat_copy.png)\n\nAs the page says, you must **store this token somewhere**, because you'll never be able to see it again, once you leave that page or close the window.\n\n::: callout-warning\nDo not ever hard-wire your PAT into your code! A PAT should always be retrieved implicitly, for example, from the Git credential store or from an environment variable.\n:::\n\n## Store your credential\n\nBelow, we will add your PAT to our the Posit Cloud Git cached credential store as a semi-persistent convenience, sort of like “remember me” on a website.\n\n**YOU MUST ALSO STORE A SECURE COPY SOMEWHERE, Either a password manager or locally on your computer for now, WE WILL NEED IT IN FUTURE SESSIONS**\n\nAdd to the file and save.\n\n### Store with `credentials` package\n\nAs of March 2024, the recommended R package for accessing the Git credential store is:\n\n-   [credentials](https://docs.ropensci.org/credentials/)\n\nIf you don't have credentials installed, install via `install.packages(\"credentials\")`.\n\nThen call `credentials::set_github_pat()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncredentials::set_github_pat()\n```\n:::\n\n\n`credentials::set_github_pat()` is a very handy function, since it populates the GITHUB_PAT environment variable using the `git_credential` manager, which `git` itself uses for storing passwords. The credential manager returns stored credentials if available, and securely prompt the user for credentials when needed.\n\nRespond to the prompt with your personal access token (PAT).\n\nYou can check that you've stored a credential with `credentials::set_github_pat()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncredentials::set_github_pat()\n```\n:::\n\n\n```         \nIf prompted for GitHub credentials, enter your PAT in the password field\nUsing GITHUB_PAT from Anna Krystalli (credential helper: cache)\n```\n\n### TODO store your PAT with a password manager\n\n**Treat this PAT like a password!** Currently, we've only store a copyable form of the PAT in the Posit CLoud credentials store cache. This cache will be cleared regularly so if we **don't store it somewhere else securely too, it will be lost!!**\n\nIf you use a password management app, such as 1Password or LastPass (which you should), it is highly recommended to store this PAT in it as a password. This way, you can easily retrieve it when needed but also manage it securely.\n\nIf for some reason you ever generate a PAT but fail to capture it on your system, you’ll have to generate another one.\n\nThis is not the end of the world, but you should delete the “lost” PAT on GitHub. If you aren’t disciplined about labelling PATs and deleting lost PATs, you will find yourself in an unsettling situation where you can’t be sure which PAT(s) are in use.\n\n::: callout-caution\nFor security reasons, Posit Cloud only caches the following configurations temporarily. While more secure, it does mean we'll need to perfom these steps in new projects and every 12 hours in older projects.\n\n**On your local system however, you will only need to do this once.**\n\nTo allow your local Rstudio application to communicate seamlessly with GitHub when pusshing and pulling through the GUI, I also recommend you go a step further and setup an ssh key. This will allow you to authenticate with GitHub without having to enter your username and password every time.\n\nSee [Set up keys for SSH](https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys#ssh-keys) in Happy Git with R as well the [`credentials` package vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/credentials/articles/intro.html) for more information.\n:::\n\n## Version Controlling projects\n\n### Turn our project into a repository\n\nIf you didn't initialise git at the beginning of your project, you can do so now with `usethis::use_git()`:\n\n::: callout-warning\nThis will try to **commit everything in the repo so far in one go!**\n\n**Override that behaviour by SELECTING A NEGATIVE RESPONSE WHEN ASKED.**\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::use_git()\n```\n:::\n\n\n``` r\n✔ Initialising Git repo\n✔ Adding '.Rhistory', '.RData' to '.gitignore'\nThere are 9 uncommitted files:\n* '.gitignore'\n* '.Rbuildignore'\n* 'analysis.R'\n* 'data-raw/'\n* 'data/'\n* 'report.html'\n* 'report.Rmd'\n* 'R/'\n* 'project.Rproj'\nIs it ok to commit them?\n\n1: Negative\n2: Nope\n3: I agree\n\nSelection: \n```\n\nNext **allow Rstudio to restart when asked:**\n\n``` r\n● A restart of RStudio is required to activate the Git pane\nRestart now?\n\n1: Absolutely\n2: Absolutely not\n3: Negative\n```\n\nThe **git panel should now be visible** in the top right of your Rstudio window.\n\nLet's now check our git setup again:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::git_sitrep()\n```\n:::\n\n\n```         \n── Git global (user) \n• Name: 'Anna Krystalli'\n• Email: 'annakrystalli@googlemail.com'\n• Global (user-level) gitignore file: <unset>\n• Vaccinated: FALSE\nℹ See `?git_vaccinate` to learn more\nℹ Defaulting to 'https' Git protocol\n• Default Git protocol: 'https'\n• Default initial branch name: <unset>\n\n── GitHub user \n• Default GitHub host: 'https://github.com'\n• Personal access token for 'https://github.com': <unset>\n• To create a personal access token, call `create_github_token()`\n• To store a token for current and future use, call `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`\nℹ Read more in the 'Managing Git(Hub) Credentials' article:\n  https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/git-credentials.html\n\n── Active usethis project: '/cloud/project' ──\n\n── Git local (project) \n• Name: 'Anna Krystalli'\n• Email: 'annakrystalli@googlemail.com'\n✖ Default branch cannot be determined.\n• Current local branch -> remote tracking branch:\n  '<unset>' -> '<unset>'\n\n── GitHub project \nℹ Project does not use GitHub\n```\n\n# Review git status\n\nIn our project, let's have a look at the Rstudio **Git** tab. It shows all the files currently in the root of our project that git is aware of. The **yellow ?** indicates none of the files have been added to git yet, i.e. git is aware of them but none are being formally tracked for changes.\n\n![](assets/git-view.png)\n\n# Ignoring files through `.gitignore`\n\nThere may be files that we don't want to commit to git, e.g.\n\n-   data files that are too large\n\n-   documents with sensitive information (eg authorisation tokens etc)\n\n-   intermediate files that we don't need to save copies of.\n\n**We can tell git to ignore them by adding them to the `.gitignore` file. By doing this upfront, we minimise the danger of committing them to our project's history by accident.**\n\n## Open `.gitignore`\n\nWhen we open `.gitgnore` we see **there are a number of standard files already added**.\n\n```         \n.Rproj.user\n.Rhistory\n.Rdata\n.httr-oauth\n.DS_Store\n.quarto\n```\n\nThese are standard files it's best practice to never commit to version control, especially if we are going to share our repository online.\n\nLet's go ahead and add the rest of the files we want to ignore.\n\n## Add files and folders to `.gitignore`\n\n### `.gitignore` regex\n\nYou can use `regex` (regular expressions) in `.gitignore` files to **ignore files according to a pattern.**\n\n-   `directoryname/*` will ignore all files in a directory.\n\n-   `*.html` will ignore any file ending in `.html`\n\n-   prefix \"!\" which negates the pattern\n\nSo let's use regex to: - ignore **all files in `attic/`** - ignore **all files in `data-raw/wood-survey-data-master/` apart from the NEON logo (`neon-logo.png`) and `references.bib` which are required to successfully render our report!**\n\nTo do so, add the following to the bottom of `.gitignore`\n\n```         \nattic/*\ndata-raw/wood-survey-data-master/*\n!data-raw/wood-survey-data-master/neon-logo.png\n!data-raw/wood-survey-data-master/references.bib\n```\n\nYou should notice that once the .gitgnore file is saved, the files and directories we've added to it are **no longer visible in the git panel as options to add to a commit.**\n\n# Commit project files\n\n## Add files\n\nThe first step of a commit is to **add the files we want to be part of the commit to the staging area.**.\n\nTo do so, just **tick the box next to any files and/or directories in the git pane**.\n\nGiven we want to commit everything, as git is ignoring files we are not interested in, it is safe to add all files to the staging area!\n\n![](assets/initial-commit-add.png)\n\n::: callout-tip\nNote how when the `data-raw` folder is selected, only 3 files are added. That's `.gitignore` in action!\n:::\n\n## Commit changes\n\nWrite an appropriate commit message (e.g. \"Initial commit\") and click the **commit** button:\n\n![](assets/initial-commit-msg.png)\n\nOnce the commit os complete, the git panel should be clear:\n\n![](assets/initial-commit-complete.png)\n\n# Create a README\n\nOur repository also needs a `README`. We only need a simple plain markdown (`.md`) file for our README.\n\nWe can create a template using `usethis::use_readme_md()`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::use_readme_md()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Edit README\n\nAdapt the template, adding a short description about your project.\n\nI've added the following:\n\n``` md\n# wood-survey\n\n<!-- badges: start -->\n\n<!-- badges: end -->\n\nThe goal of wood-survey is to analyse the relationship between stem diameter and height in NEON vegetation survey data.\n\nA report of our analysis can be found [here](report.html)\n```\n\nAdd and commit your new README\n\n![](assets/use-readme-commit.png)\n\n![](assets/use-readme-complete.png)\n\n# Create repository on GitHub\n\nSo far we've only been working with a local version (i.e. only available to us in Posit Cloud) of our project. **Now we want to share it with the world through GitHub!**\n\nBecause have set up a `GITHUP_PAT`, we can use function `usethis::use_github()` to create a GitHub repository for our project:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::use_github(protocol = \"https\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n``` r\n✔ Creating GitHub repository 'annakrystalli/project'\n✔ Setting remote 'origin' to 'https://github.com/annakrystalli/project.git'\n✔ Pushing 'master' branch to GitHub and setting 'origin/master' as upstream branch\n✔ Opening URL 'https://github.com/annakrystalli/project'\n```\n\nOnce the repo is created and any commmited files pushed, the repo is launched in the browser:\n\n![](assets/use-github.png)\n\n# Host html content on GitHub\n\nLet's head to the repo and have a look at what we've shared. To host our html content on GitHub, we need to **enable `gh-pages`** in our repository.\n\n## Enable `gh-pages`\n\nGo to repo **Settings** and navigate to the **Pages** panel on the left hand side and change your settings to the following configuration: - **Source:** Deploy from a branch. - **Branch:** `master` - {{< fa folder >}} **Folder:** `/ (root)` - Ensure the *Enforce HTTPS* option is selected.\n\nand **Save**{.btn .btn-primary}\n\n![](assets/gh-pages-enable.png)\n\n## Check Deployed Site\n\nOnce the site has been successfully deployed, you will see a message like this (you might need to refresh the page):\n\n!{[ ](assets/gh-pages-deployed.png)\n\nClick on the link displayed and go check out your work!\n\n::: callout-note\nNote that my URL looks a bit different to yours. That's because I'm redirecting all my GitHub pages to my personal domain. Yours will be something like `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>`\n:::\n\n### Landing page\n\nThe landing page of your site will be the `README.md` file (although you could override this if the root of your project contained a `index.md` or `index.html` file).\n\n![](assets/gh-pages-landing-page.png) From there you can click through to the rendered report page (or you can add `/report.html` to the end of the URL to go directly to the report).\n\n### Report\n\n![](assets/gh-pages-report-page.png)\n\nScroll through and check out the interactive features like the table of contents, code folding and table, figure and citation previews when hovering over their mentions!\n\n## Add URL to repo About panel\n\nA useful feature of GitHub is the ability to include a link to any hosted content in the **About** panel of your repository. This is a great way to direct visitors to the rendered content of your project.\n\nTo add the URL to the **About** panel, click on the {{< fa cog>}} button next to **About** and check the **Use your GitHub Pages website** box:\n\n![](assets/gh-pages-add-repo-link.png) Once added, visitors can easily navigate to the hosted content from the repo landing page:\n\n![](assets/gh-pages-complete-repo.png)\n\n# `Git` tips\n\n-   commit early, commit often\n-   commit logical bits of work together\n-   write meaninful messages\n\n## Further Resources\n\n-   [Git-it](http://jlord.us/git-it/)\n-   [Happy with Git](http://happygitwithr.com/)\n-   [Oh Shit Git](http://ohshitgit.com/)\n\n### Never forget\n\n![](assets/in_case_of_fire.png)\n",
