This will save a lot of time by avoiding having to run a long installation scripts during the class or debug individual installation problems.\n\n### Launch Posit Cloud project\n\nTo access this project, please click on the **supplied project link**\n\nThis should drop you into the **ACCE DTP Reproducible research in R Workspace**. If not, navigate to the space from the menu on the top left.\n\n![](assets/rsc_space_copy.png)\n\nIn there you will find a project called **wood-survey**. Click on **+ Copy** to create your own copy of the project.\n\n![](assets/rsc_copy_proj.png)\n\n![](assets/rsc_copy_proj2.png)\n\nYou now have your own copy of the project.\n\n![](assets/rsc_new_proj_name_wd.png)\n\n## Rstudio IDE Global Options\n\nYou can customise your RStudio IDE to suit your preferences. To access the global options, click on **Tools \\> Global Options**.\n\nLet's go ahead and set up some useful options:\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## General\n\nIn the General tab you can customise default configurations for your R Sessions & Workspace.\n\n![](assets/rstudio-global-general.png)\n\n-   **Restore .RData into workspace at startup**: This will stop R from loading an .RData file into your workspace when you start RStudio.\n-   **Save workspace to .RData on exit: Never**: This will ensure your workspace is never saved to an .RData file when you exit RStudio.\n-   **Always save history (even when not saving .RData)**: This tells RStudio NOT to save your history to a .Rhistory file.\n\n**These settings ensure a clean fresh environment each time you start RStudio.**\n\n## Code\n\nIn the Code Editing tab you can customise how you would like your code to be edited.\n\n![](assets/rstudio-global-code-editing.png)\n\n-   **Auto-detect code indention**: This will automatically detect the appropriate indentation of your code.\n-   **Use native pipe operator**: When using the insert Pipe command (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + M), the native pipe operator `|>` instead of the magrittr pipe operator `%>%` will be inserted.\n-   **Soft-wrap R source files**: This will wrap your code to the next line when it reaches the end of the screen.\n-   **Continue comment when inserting new line**: This will continue the comment when you press enter at the end of a line that is a comment.\n\nIn the display tab you can customise how you would like your code to be displayed.\n\n![](assets/rstudio-global-code-display.png) - **Highlight selected line**: This will highlight the line of code that you are currently working on. - **Highlight R function calls**: This will highlight the function calls in your code. - **Use rainbow parentheses**: This will colour code your parentheses to make it easier to see where they open and close.\n\n## Appearance\n\nIn the Appearance panel you are able to customise the appearance of the IDE including text size, font, and editor theme.\n\n![](assets/rstudio-global-appearance.png)\n:::\n\n### Creating projects locally\n\nTo create a new project locally in Rstudio, you can either use **File \\> New Project \\> New Directory**, or in the console (you only need to run this once, so you don't want it to be part of a repeatable script) run:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::create_project(\"~/Desktop/wood-survey\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.alert .alert-danger}\nIn general, do not use such hard code paths in repeatable scripts. They might not work across operating systems and are unlikely to generalise across someone elses file system.\n:::\n\nYou will also need to run the `setup/install.R` script. See the [setup instructions](setup.qmd) for more details.\n\n",
