## **GitHub for science**

> -   ideal for managing the full suite of research outputs such as datasets, statistical code, figures, lab notes, and manuscripts.

> -   supports peer review, commenting, and discussion.

> -   Diverse range of efforts, from individual to large bioinformatics projects, laboratory repositories, as well as global collaborations have found a home on GitHub

## Remote repositories

centralising information e.g. [**weecology** / ***"Nine simple ways to make it easier to (re)use your data" paper***](http://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/IEE/article/view/4608/0) \| [Repo](https://github.com/weecology/data-sharing-paper)

```{r, out.width="80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/repo-1.png")
```

## Commits

Traceability. **Entire process of project evolution reproducible.**

# **Practical: Github & Rstudio for collaborative coding**

## **#EvoLottery**

**Beak and skull shapes in birds of prey (“raptors”) are strongly coupled and largely controlled by size.**

-   In this exercise, each participant will **fork a github repo**, and **contribute a file** required to simulate the *evolutionary trajectory of an imaginary species' body size*.

-   We'll use **github** to **collate all species files** and **plot** them all up together at the end! We'll also **discover the skull and beak shapes** associated with each simulated species size.
